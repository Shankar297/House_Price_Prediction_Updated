## Problem Statement
The goal of this statistical analysis is to help us understand the relationship between house features and how these variables are used to predict house price.

## Approach
Data Exploration : Exploring dataset using pandas, numpy.

Feature Engineering : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.

Model Building & Testing : Tried many machine learning algorithms and checked the base accuracy to find the best fit.

Pickle File : Created pickle file as per need.

Building web app : Building web app using python.

User Interface & deployment :  Created an UI that shows the output.
                          After that I have deployed project on heroku.
